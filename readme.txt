Features of the game
1. Ships can be of custom length ( textures will adjust  automatically whatever length of ship is chosen)

2. Immutable vs Unmodifiable collection  in java
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2185789/what-is-the-difference-between-googles-immutablelist-and-collections-unmodifiab#:~:text=Unlike%20Collections.,data%20and%20will%20never%20change.
Collections that do not support modification operations (such as add, remove and clear) are referred to as unmodifiable.
Collections that are not unmodifiable are modifiable.

Collections that additionally guarantee that no change in the Collection object will be visible are referred to as immutable.
Collections that are not immutable are mutable.

My thoughts how to expose model to the controller so data are not changed accidentally
